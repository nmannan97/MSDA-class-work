functionality such as shown following:

1) Pop the value

2) Push the value

3) is_empty to check if stack is empty

4) Print the last element

 

Once implemented , you need to refer MyStack container to reverse the file. This will be your stack 
which can be used like Python provided stack functionality on list but it strictly follows the stack
rules. You can refer mystack_hw.py file uploaded in files folder under Week 4 and fill up the 
functions accordingly.

Note: You must implement all the functions provided in mystack_hw.py.
